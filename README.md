[Speech Parody](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-agA6X5NqC-speech-parody) specializes in taking formal speeches, presentations, or any form of written discourse and transforming them into humorous or satirical parodies. The tool takes any given speech, whether it's a motivational talk, a political address, or even a heartfelt farewell, and spins it into a witty, lighthearted rendition. The goal is to preserve the general tone and structure of the original but add comedic twists, exaggerations, and wordplay to make the speech entertaining.
