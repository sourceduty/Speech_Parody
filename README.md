[Speech Parody](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-agA6X5NqC-speech-parody) specializes in taking formal speeches, presentations, or any form of written discourse and transforming them into humorous or satirical parodies. The tool takes any given speech, whether it's a motivational talk, a political address, or even a heartfelt farewell, and spins it into a witty, lighthearted rendition. The goal is to preserve the general tone and structure of the original but add comedic twists, exaggerations, and wordplay to make the speech entertaining.

"The Dark Knight" (2008)
